# Animalpusher

!['grid.png'](Grid)

The students at WU25 got to play the somewhat unfinished game "Snowy, the pusher" during their pen-and-paper-code day. This repository is a try to create a digital version of the game, using PHP.

## Installation

1. Use the green button (Code) to copy the repo adress
1. In your terminal, move to a good place and `git clone [the cloned adress] [a-good-name-for-your-repo-or-leave-to-use-the-name-animal-pusher]`
1. cd [repo name]
1. php -S localhost:8000

## Contriubute

Yes, if you want to. There might be some issues up for grabs, and if not, create a PR and let me take a look.
